Welcome to Threat-Watch, the most privacy-focused cybersecurity news app in the world. This README provides an overview of the app's features, installation instructions, how to contribute, and more.

## Features

- Stay up-to-date with the latest cybersecurity news and trends.

- Privacy-focused: We prioritize user privacy and have a no data collection policy. We will never collect or give any of your personal data away to third-parties, not even anonymously. (GDPR compliant)

- Minimal Third-Party Dependence: In our commitment to user privacy, we minimize reliance on third-party services wherever possible.

- Battle hardened: Integration of Zero Trust Architecture in every corner of the app.

- User-first policy: Users have the most influence on which additional features will be added in the app.

- User-friendly interface: Intuitive design for easy navigation.

- No ads for free.

- No central server, everything is run either inside the user's device or inside an API, thus making it almost impossible for a breach to ever happen.
