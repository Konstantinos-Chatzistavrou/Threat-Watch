Welcome to Threat-Watch, the most privacy-focused cybersecurity news app in the world. This README provides an overview of the app's features, installation instructions, how to contribute, and more.

## Features

- Battle hardened: Integration of Zero Trust Architecture in every corner of the app.

- User-first policy: Users have the most influence on which additional features will be added in the app.
