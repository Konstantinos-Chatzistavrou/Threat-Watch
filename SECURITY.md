# Project Security Policy

## Introduction

Welcome to our project's security policy. Security is a top priority, and we're committed to maintaining a safe environment for all users.

## Supported Versions

• Version 0.0.1 ✗ ([UI testing version])

• Version 0.0.2 ✓

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability within our project, we highly appreciate your responsible disclosure. To report a vulnerability, please provide the following information:

1. **Description**: Clearly explain the vulnerability, its potential impact, and any scenarios or conditions necessary to reproduce it.

2. **Steps to Reproduce**: Detail the exact steps needed to reproduce the vulnerability.

3. **Technical Details**: Include any relevant technical information, such as affected components, libraries, or code snippets.

4. **Contact Information**: Provide your contact details (name and email) so we can acknowledge your report and keep you informed about the resolution process.

You can report the vulnerability by emailing us at:  threatwatchapp@gmail.com. 

We are committed to promptly addressing security issues and will acknowledge your report as soon as it's received. We kindly request that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a chance to investigate and mitigate it.

We appreciate your cooperation in helping us maintain the security of our project.

## Security Measures

Safeguarding our project and user data is our utmost priority. We employ the following comprehensive security measures:

• **Secure Coding Practices**: Our experienced development team adheres to secure coding practices, including input validation, output encoding, and defense against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

• **Regular Dependency Updates**: We proactively monitor and update third-party dependencies to ensure they are free from known vulnerabilities. This helps us maintain the stability and security of our project.

• **Contributor Security**: All contributors are required to use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication (2FA). This adds an additional layer of security to protect contributors' accounts from unauthorized access.

• **Code Review Process**: Every code change, including pull requests, undergoes rigorous review and approval before being merged into the main branch. This process helps identify potential security issues and ensures that only safe and well-tested code is deployed.

By implementing these security measures, we strive to provide a robust and secure environment for our project and its users.

## Privacy Concerns

Your privacy is important to us. We handle user data carefully and follow industry best practices to safeguard sensitive information.

## Incident Response

It's important to have a clear understanding of what qualifies as a security incident to trigger the incident response protocol. A security incident refers to any actual or suspected breach of security that could potentially compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our project or its data.

Some examples of security incidents include:

• Unauthorized access to sensitive data or systems

• Data breaches or leaks

• Malware infections or compromises

• Denial of Service (DoS) attacks

• Compromised accounts or credentials

If you observe any activity or situation that aligns with these examples or any suspicious behavior that could impact security, it's crucial to promptly report it to our security team. Even if you're uncertain whether an incident has occurred, it's always better to err on the side of caution and notify us.

Our incident response plan, outlined below, will guide us through the appropriate steps to contain, mitigate, and recover from any confirmed incidents.

In the unfortunate event of a security incident, we follow a well-defined incident response plan to ensure timely and effective resolution. Our plan consists of the following key stages:

1. **Identification**: We promptly identify and confirm the occurrence of the incident, determining its scope and potential impact.

2. **Containment**: Immediate measures are taken to contain the incident and prevent further unauthorized access or data compromise.

3. **Eradication**: We work diligently to eliminate the root cause of the incident and any lingering vulnerabilities.

4. **Recovery**: After the threat has been neutralized, we begin the process of restoring affected systems and services to normal operation.

5. **Lessons Learned**: Once the incident is resolved, we conduct a thorough analysis of the incident to identify lessons learned and implement improvements to prevent similar incidents in the future.

Our Computer Security Incident Handling Guide provides detailed procedures for each stage and ensures a coordinated and effective response.

Rest assured, our priority is to swiftly address any security incident and minimize its impact on our project and users.

Thank you for your collaboration in making our project safer for everyone.
